jrpg-engine
===========
*Java RPG Engine*

**jrpg-engine** is intended to be a java library designed to make writing your own SNES era Japanese RPG game 
(think *Final Fantasy 4-6* or *Chrono Trigger*) easier. **jrpg-engine** is built for Java developers who want to make 
RPG games. This is different than tools like RPG Maker and RPG Boss which give you WYSISYG editors for building your 
game. This project is intended to be a Java library that gives you powerful APIs for building worlds, characters, 
combat systems and dialog. **jrpg-engine** is not a generic graphics or game engine. In fact it uses Lib GDX under the
hood to fill this function. **jrpg-engine** handles the higher level abstractions specific to this game genre.

This project is just getting underway and is not yet very useful. If the idea of a Java RPG engine excites you, check
back in as I make progress.
